# Resonance

## Overview

It is a web application designed to bring the experience of modular sound synthesis to your browser. It enables users to experiment with various sound generation and modification techniques using a virtual modular synthesizer.
This application is perfect for music enthusiasts, sound designers, and anyone curious about exploring the fundamentals of sound synthesis.

## Features

### 1. **Modules**
- **Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** Generates basic waveforms like sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth. Adjust the frequency to control pitch and create diverse sounds.
- **Filters:**
  - Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF): Customize cutoff frequency and resonance to sculpt sound.
  - Low Pass Filters (2-Pole and 4-Pole): Shape the sound by attenuating high frequencies with different steepness.
- **Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO):** Modulate sound properties like pitch and amplitude with slow oscillations.
- **Envelope Generator:** Control attack and release times to shape the amplitude of your sound.
- **Reverb:** Simulate acoustic spaces for depth and spatial effects.
- **Echo:** Add rhythmic delays with adjustable time and feedback.
- **Distortion:** Introduce harmonics and saturation for aggressive sound textures.
- **Flanger & Chorus:** Create swirling and ensemble-like effects by mixing modulated and original signals.

### 2. **Real-Time Oscilloscope**
Visualize sound waves in real-time to better understand and fine-tune your audio.

### 3. **Sequencer**
- Build melodic sequences using an 8/16/32-step sequencer.
- Adjust BPM and sequence length to match your creative needs.

## How to Use

1. **Start Synthesizing:**
   - Click the "Start" button to initialize the synthesizer.
   - Use the menu to toggle modules on or off.

2. **Create Sounds:**
   - Adjust sliders and parameters to explore various sound effects.
   - Use the VCO to generate your base waveform.

3. **Apply Effects:**
   - Toggle filters, reverb, echo, and more to modify your sound.
   - Combine effects for unique audio textures.

4. **Build Sequences:**
   - Open the sequencer module and activate steps to create melodic patterns.
   - Adjust the BPM to control playback speed.

## What You Can Do with This App

- **Sound Design:** Create complex soundscapes for music, games, or other media.
- **Music Production:** Experiment with melodies and rhythms to spark creative ideas.
- **Learning Tool:** Understand the basics of modular synthesis, filters, and effects in an intuitive way.
